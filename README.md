# Overview

Deep convolutional neural networks are effective tools for performing various perceptual tasks including face perception, object recognition, speech processing, among others. Here we provide a MATLAB implementation of a deep convolutional neural network that recognizes the emotion associated with a wide variety of visual scenes. 

A full text manuscript describing the development and validation of this model is described [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaw4358).

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

For minimal performance we recommend a computer with at least 8 GB of RAM, 32GB of SSD storage, and an Intel or AMD x86-64 processor with two or more cores. 

For faster performance, MATLAB supports NVIDIAÂ® GPU architectures with compute capability 3.5 to 9.x.
